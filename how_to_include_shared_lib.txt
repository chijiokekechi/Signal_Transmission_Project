When running a binary file that requires use of a shared library, the library can be properly linked to in one of 2 ways:

METHOD 1
Step 1: Run the following line in the terminal...

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to .so file>:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

Step 2: Run the binary file from the terminal like usual...

        ./run.exe

METHOD 2
Step 1: Run the binary file from the terminal like below...

        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to .so file>:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ./run.exe

Note: Method 2 is the only method that works in a Makefile. It can be shortened to a Makefile variable and used the in the following "shorthand" alternative (especially handy if used at multiple places within the Makefile).

        LIB_PATH = LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to .so file>:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" 
        $(LIB_PATH) ./run.exe
